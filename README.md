This **GlucoGuard**  is basically an Diabetics Prediction tool made using python and machine learn algorithm (Support vector Machine )
Tech Stack used :
**Programming Language:**

Python: The primary language used for developing the diabetes prediction model due to its simplicity and extensive libraries for data analysis and machine learning.

**Libraries and Frameworks:**

**Pandas**:Used for data manipulation and analysis.
Helps in reading CSV files and preprocessing data.


**NumPy**:Provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.
Useful for numerical computations.
**Scikit-learn**:A key library for machine learning in Python.
Algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and others can be utilized for building the prediction model.

**Machine-learning algorithm used :-**
Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm commonly used for classification and regression tasks. It is particularly effective in high-dimensional spaces and is known for its robustness in handling both linear and non-linear data. 

**Applications of SVM:**
**Text Classification:** SVM is widely used in text classification tasks, such as spam detection and sentiment analysis.
**Image Classification:** It is used in image recognition tasks, where it can classify images based on features extracted from them.
**Bioinformatics:** SVM is applied in various bioinformatics applications, such as protein classification and gene expression analysis.




**Explanation of the Code**


Data Loading: The dataset is loaded from a CSV file. Ensure that the file path is correct.

Data Preprocessing:Features (X) are separated from the target variable (Y).
The features are standardized using StandardScaler to ensure that they have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.


Train-Test Split: The dataset is split into training and testing sets, with 20% of the data reserved for testing.

Model Training: An SVM classifier with a linear kernel is created and trained on the training data.

Model Evaluation: The accuracy of the model is calculated for both training and testing datasets. A classification report and confusion matrix are printed for a detailed evaluation.

Making Predictions: The model can predict whether a person is diabetic based on input data. You can replace the example input data with user input as needed.
